* Version number bumped to 2.0.6

* Added console demo example:
  - examples/console/demo_hash_large_file.lpr: Large file hashing (>5 GB)
    with real-time progress (%, MB/s, elapsed time), manual Hash.Update()
    loop with 64 KB blocks to avoid UpdateStream integer overflow,
    --size=N and --dir=path options, robust error handling

* Added {$MODE Delphi} directive to dcpbase64.pas and dcpconst.pas
  (were the only units missing it, -Mdelphi flag no longer required)

* Switched all 4 console examples from {$MODE Delphi} to {$MODE ObjFPC}{$H+}

* Switched all GUI example files from {$MODE Delphi} to {$MODE ObjFPC}{$H+}

* Removed -Mdelphi from Makefile example build flags
